bitcamp 2019

Hello!

This project was created for **bitcamp 2019**. It was our first time working with machine learning, so it's rather unpolished, but we're excited to get to present and show off all we learned!

To modify this file, clone the repo and modify the path to the audio file in a notebook editor, and hit run all. Is our prediction accurate? :)
